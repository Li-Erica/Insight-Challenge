This was implemented to allow visualization of the graph and to help with debugging. draw.sh operates the same way as run.sh but will draw the graph using a Kamada & Kawai force directed layout. code was developed for and tested with ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\r\n\r\nI used the igraph module becuase it supports a lot of graph operations. The challenge only requested the mean degree, so I could have gotten away using some lower level data structures but in a real application, we would want more than just the average degree. Igraph supports many other graph operations so I think its a good tradeoff. \r\n\r\n",
